# Beacon .NET

Beacon .NET is a .NET automatic-instrumentation distribution maintained as a
full-source downstream of OpenTelemetry .NET Automatic Instrumentation. This
repository is not a GitHub fork.

The project ships Linux glibc, Linux musl, Windows, macOS, and NuGet archives
for x64 and applicable ARM64 platforms, together with Windows MSI and Linux
DEB/RPM packages. Releases also include Shell and PowerShell installers,
checksums, an SPDX SBOM, and build attestations. After publication, the release
assets are downloaded again and used to run .NET 8 applications. End-to-end
DataKit ingestion is not currently within the verified support scope.

See the [Beacon development guide](beacon/README.md) for development, upstream
synchronization, artifacts, and release preparation. Inherited OpenTelemetry
usage and implementation documentation is available under
[OpenTelemetry .NET Automatic Instrumentation](docs/README.md).

## Native Packages

Beacon provides a Windows MSI, Linux DEB/RPM packages, and the unified
`beacon-dotnet` command. Download the Release asset matching the host architecture
and install it:

```bash
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt install ./beacon-dotnet-<version>-linux-amd64.deb

# RHEL / Rocky / Fedora
sudo dnf install ./beacon-dotnet-<version>-linux-x86_64.rpm
```

```powershell
# Run from an elevated Windows PowerShell session
Start-Process msiexec.exe -Wait -ArgumentList '/i beacon-dotnet-<version>-windows-x64.msi'
```

After installation, use the same commands on every supported platform:

```text
beacon-dotnet status
beacon-dotnet run <application-command> [arguments]
beacon-dotnet uninstall
```

Linux musl, macOS, containers, and non-administrator installations continue to
use the ZIP/Shell installation path.

## Uninstalling ZIP Installations

On Linux and macOS, run the uninstaller from the installation directory:

```sh
sh "$HOME/.otel-dotnet-auto/uninstall.sh"
```

On Windows, run the installation-directory uninstaller as an administrator:

```powershell
& "$env:ProgramFiles\OpenTelemetry .NET AutoInstrumentation\uninstall.ps1"
```

The Windows command cleans the current session and automatically detects and
removes IIS and Windows Service registrations that reference the current Beacon
installation. See the [usage documentation](docs/README.md#powershell-module-windows)
for detailed options.
